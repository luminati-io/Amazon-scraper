I tend to use them a lot to listen to music, watch livestreams or tune in to work meetings. Due to the nature of the extendable plastic top part, it does tend to crack at the sides. So, be careful of how you store your headphones. HOWEVER, I use these headphones nearly daily and find myself needing a replacement about a year later due to wear and tear. I keep coming back since these headphones have quickly become my favorite and reliable brand/pair to use!",

But given the price it is an excellent performer and five star for its sound and comfort and good looks and quality feel for a very low price. It is a great addition to my Chromebook giving me a great sound experience to go with my quick Chromebook and Prime Video TV shows and movies.",
